The Peer-to-Peer Trusted Library Changes
========================================

Release 0.2
===========
* Added support for PKCS#7 digital envelopes (see
  PTP::Store::Import/ExportEnvelope())
* Added cleaner HTTP interface to PTP::Net::Connection
  (see Connection::Read/WriteHttp())

  if a proxy is present, a direct PtP connect is tried
  before a connection through the proxy (added timeout
  support throughout PTP::Net::Connection)
* Added network endian handling to PTP::Net
  (see PTP::Net::Get/Set32 and PTP::Net::Get/Set16)
* Updated build system (build OpenSSL, build the PtPTL
  as a DLL, separate Win32/Linux configuration files)
* Added Base64 encoding support (see PTP::Encoding)
* Moved random number generator to its own class
  (see PTP::Random)
* Retooled "cert" sample and added documentation.
* Added "sfs" sample and removed "gnut" sample.
* Added better pattern matching to PTP::Collection::Find
  (matches on simple wildcards '*' or '?')
* Several one line bug fixes
